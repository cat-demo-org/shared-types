# Shared Types

Thie repository is to house all common interfaces that are to be used by front-end and back-end infrastructure

## Editing types

All shared types should be included in this repository

While developing types run `pnpm dev` to automatically update the dist file as needed

**Include the dist in the repository**  

Due to the insignificant data size, include the dist with the repository until apprpriate build steps are decided on if necessary
